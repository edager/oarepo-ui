# Customizatison

If you want to use your own layout elements in layout configurations, you can do
so by writing custom components and providing it to the layout generator.

## Writing components

For a guide on how to:

- write custom layout elements used by server-side rendered pages (e.g. record detail page), see: [Jinja2 elements](./jinja2.md)
- write custom dynamic layout components (e.g. for search result formatting), see [React components](./react.md) .
- customize whole pages (e.g. search page), see [Custom pages](pages.md).
